## Usage:

Start the Django development server from your terminal:

Open two different browsers or two instances of the same browser, with one instance in incognito mode, and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

If you are not already logged in, you will be presented with the Django admin login page. Log in using your superuser credentials.

After successful login, you will be taken to the Django admin dashboard. Click on the "VIEW SITE" link at the top right to navigate to the video call page.

In each of the browsers you opened, the other users registered on the application will be displayed.

In one browser, you can call the user who is logged in and on the other browser by clicking the button that bears their name.

The other user will be prompted to click the "Accept" button to fully establish the call.
